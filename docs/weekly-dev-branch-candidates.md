# Weekly-dev branch candidates

Generated for `vkvw-hzzg — Discuss additional weekly-dev branch candidates` on 2026-07-28.

## Short answer: did we cover all local branches?

No. We covered the high-value/recent branches that came through the forms, but the local repositories still contain **124 VD `vk/*` branches** and **149 VK `vk/*` branches**. Many are stale/no-delta/already-merged, but a meaningful remainder was **not** discussed in the forms and should be triaged before any merge attempt. The appendices below list every local `vk/*` branch observed by `git for-each-ref` and mark whether it was covered.

Current policy decisions from the forms:

- Require fresh current-dev review/spot-check before merge; old approval alone is not enough.
- For paired VK/VD efforts, review and test the pair together when the changes depend on each other.
- Require full impl/review/overseer evidence or reconstruct it from session conversations before final merge.
- Do not kick off a large number of new reviews at once.
- Use plain `https://jamtools.dev/workspaces/:workspace_id` links.

## Immediate review batch

| Repo | Branch | Workspace | Current local delta | Stage | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| VK | `vk/60aa-vk-last-message` | [VK - Last Message](https://jamtools.dev/workspaces/60aa4bba-0ad5-4083-bbd8-aacdf4145ab7) (deleted worktree) | ahead 7, behind 13, 16 files | Immediate fresh review | User definitely wants in; overseer/review2 was kicked off. Require session-conversation approval and aggregate current-dev spot check. |
| VK | `vk/8192-vk-make-urls-cli` | [VK - Make urls clickable](https://jamtools.dev/workspaces/819247a5-56d7-4ef7-b123-f7500b43efb5) (deleted worktree) | ahead 1, behind 13, 4 files | Immediate fresh review | Low-risk candidate, but still needs fresh current-dev approval evidence. |
| VK | `vk/109f-vk-stop-retry-ca` | [VK - Stop/Retry cancels other agent runs](https://jamtools.dev/workspaces/109f9c41-a5ee-448b-b21b-708db6c1d484) | ahead 3, behind 15, 17 files | Immediate fresh review | Workspace link now resolves.

Treat as pair with VD and do not merge one side blindly. |
| VK | `vk/55fd-vd-themes-and-sk` | [VD - Themes and Skins](https://jamtools.dev/workspaces/55fdc4b2-da37-4f1b-a5cc-78b1d4e51513) (deleted worktree) | ahead 3, behind 29, 17 files | Immediate/thorough review | Selected; likely foundation for corresponding VD theme work. Fresh approval needed. |

## Done, deferred, or cleanup/discard

| Repo | Branch | Workspace | Current local delta | Stage | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| VK | `vk/371a-vk-performance-p` | [VK - Performance Profiling](https://jamtools.dev/workspaces/371a1d8d-f8c6-4636-b556-85afcbb4aeaa) | ahead 0, behind 0, 0 files | Done / no current delta | Inventory now shows no local diff from weekly dev. Treat as merged/complete unless remote tip changed. |

## Recommended next steps

1. Wait for or inspect the fresh current-dev review for [VK 60aa — VK - Last Message](https://jamtools.dev/workspaces/60aa4bba-0ad5-4083-bbd8-aacdf4145ab7).
2. Start only one additional no-overseer review at a time after VK 60aa, likely `vk/109f-vk-stop-retry-ca` or `vk/2039-vk-postmessage-o` depending on urgency.
3. Delete/discard the VK-side `vk/038d-vd-use-diffs-com` workspace/branch only after confirming no unpushed local work is needed; keep researching the VD-side branch.
4. Before merging any candidate, re-run the standard preflight: fetch, clean status, exact tip verification, merge-tree, diff summary, review session evidence, and validation plan.
