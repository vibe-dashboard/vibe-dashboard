# Encoded preview host routing

Vibe Dashboard preview hosts use a first-level encoded hostname so Cloudflare TLS
and wildcard routing only need to cover `*.vibedashboard.dev`:

```text
{workspaceToken}-{repoSlug}-{slotSlug}-{customerSlug}.vibedashboard.dev
```

Example:

```text
0123456789abcdef-vibekanban-web-mickmister.vibedashboard.dev
```

The encoded data must fit in the first DNS label, so V1 uses fixed separators
and dashless lowercase alphanumeric slugs:

- `workspaceToken`: exactly 16 lowercase hexadecimal characters (`[a-f0-9]{16}`).
- `repoSlug`: 1–18 lowercase alphanumeric characters.
- `slotSlug`: 1–10 lowercase alphanumeric characters.
- `customerSlug`: 1–16 lowercase alphanumeric characters.

The full first-label budget is `16 + 18 + 10 + 16 + 3 separators = 63`
characters. Old `preview-{workspace}-{slot}--{customer}` numeric hosts are
intentionally rejected; this branch is a hard break with no backwards
compatibility for numeric slots.
The Caddy handler defaults to this `vibedashboard.dev` base domain via
`PREVIEW_BASE_DOMAIN`; local/dev deployments using another customer base domain
must set that variable explicitly.

This compact first-label pattern is reserved under `PREVIEW_BASE_DOMAIN`.
Customer hostnames that merely contain dashes are not preview hosts unless the
first label satisfies the full `workspaceToken-repoSlug-slotSlug-customerSlug`
grammar.

## Runtime request flow

1. The public Cloudflare Worker receives the encoded preview host.
2. The Worker resolves the customer part to the canonical customer hostname and
   forwards traffic through the customer tunnel.
3. The Worker preserves the original encoded hostname in `X-Vibe-Requested-Host`
   for the private-sandbox V1 deployment.
4. The custom Caddy `vk_preview_resolver` handler reads the requested hostname
   from `X-Vibe-Requested-Host` when present. Otherwise, it ignores generic
   forwarded host headers and uses the actual request `Host`.
5. If the hostname matches the preview syntax, Caddy calls the local resolver API.
6. The resolver returns `ready` with an upstream, `starting`, `not_found`,
   `capacity_full`, or `failed`/`unavailable`.
7. Caddy proxies ready traffic or serves a startup/unavailable response.

## Hard-break compatibility contract

The named-host shape is the only supported Preview URL contract for this branch.
Backend and Worker code must be deployed with the same grammar:

- Caddy no longer sends `workspaceId`, numeric `slot`, or `customer`.
- The resolver must map `workspaceToken` to the durable VK workspace ID.
- `repoSlug` and `slotSlug` are lookup slugs for the repo-level run config and
  preview slot; they are not database IDs.
- `customerSlug` is the customer alias used by the Worker/control plane to find
  the canonical customer runtime.
- The Worker must parse or preserve the full encoded preview host, route it to
  the matching canonical customer runtime, and forward the original host in
  `X-Vibe-Requested-Host`. V1 intentionally does not use a requested-host
  shared secret because the deployment is limited to the private/Cloudflare
  Access-protected sandbox. The proper per-customer/runtime secret model is
  tracked separately.

## Resolver API

`vk_preview_resolver` sends a local-only JSON POST to the configured
`resolver_url`:

```json
{
  "host": "0123456789abcdef-vibekanban-web-mickmister.vibedashboard.dev",
  "workspaceToken": "0123456789abcdef",
  "repoSlug": "vibekanban",
  "slotSlug": "web",
  "customerSlug": "mickmister",
  "ensure": true,
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/"
}
```

`ensure` is only true for page-load navigations: `GET`, not a protocol upgrade,
and `Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate` or `Sec-Fetch-Dest: document`. Asset, API, and
WebSocket requests do not start preview servers by themselves.

Expected response:

```json
{ "status": "ready", "upstream": "http://127.0.0.1:4567" }
```

Other statuses:

- `starting`: render startup page for navigations, plain 503 for non-document requests.
- `not_found`: 404.
- `capacity_full`: 503.
- `failed`, `unavailable`, `error`: 502.

The resolver owns workspace validation, preview process state, max-running-server
capacity, and eviction policy. The Caddy module owns request parsing and proxying.

When proxying a ready preview upstream, Caddy forwards preview metadata headers:

- `X-Vibe-Requested-Host`
- `X-Vibe-Preview-Workspace-Token`
- `X-Vibe-Preview-Repo`
- `X-Vibe-Preview-Slot`
- `X-Vibe-Preview-Customer`

Before setting those canonical metadata headers, Caddy removes inbound
`Forwarded`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Vibe-Requested-Host`, and
`X-Vibe-Preview-*` headers so preview apps cannot receive spoofed preview
metadata from clients.

## Requested-host header trust model

Direct clients can set arbitrary `X-Forwarded-Host` or `X-Vibe-Requested-Host`
headers. For V1, Preview URLs are limited to the private/Cloudflare
Access-protected sandbox, so Caddy accepts `X-Vibe-Requested-Host` as the Worker
preserved-host signal and still ignores generic `X-Forwarded-Host`.

Release guard: do not deploy this no-secret requested-host mode on a public or
direct-origin path. The customer runtime/Caddy ingress must be reachable only
through the private/Cloudflare Access-protected sandbox routing boundary until
`vkvw-murh — Design proper per-customer Preview URL secret seeding` (or an
equivalent platform attestation design) is implemented. If a deployment can
receive public direct-origin traffic, requested-host trust must be disabled or
replaced with stronger attestation before release.

Worker request to Caddy:

- `X-Vibe-Requested-Host: {workspaceToken}-{repoSlug}-{slotSlug}-{customerSlug}.vibedashboard.dev`

Advanced deployments may override the requested-host header name with
`PREVIEW_REQUESTED_HOST_HEADER` or the equivalent Caddyfile option
`trusted_requested_host_header`.
