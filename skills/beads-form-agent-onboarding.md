# BeadsForm agent onboarding

Use BeadsForm when you need structured answers from a human before proceeding. Prefer bead-backed forms for real workflow.

## 1. Draft standard form JSON inline

Write standard BeadsForm JSON. Prefer the standard DSL, not raw HTML. The default bead-backed workflow is **inline JSON via stdin** so agents do not need to create a temporary `form.json` file first. Use a file only when the form is large enough that audit/debuggability matters.

Example JSON shape:

```json
{
  "format": "standard",
  "id": "implementation_questions",
  "title": "Implementation questions",
  "description": "Resolve decisions before code changes.",
  "allowCodeFileChanges": {
    "label": "Allow implementation after this response",
    "description": "Use allow-code only if the next agent may edit code/files.",
    "defaultChecked": false
  },
  "questions": [
    {
      "type": "choices",
      "id": "next_step",
      "title": "Next step",
      "description": "Choose the safest next step.",
      "choices": [
        {
          "id": "implement",
          "label": "Implement now",
          "description": "Proceed with code changes.",
          "is_recommended_reason": "This is the smallest merge-safe slice."
        },
        {
          "id": "ask_more",
          "label": "Ask more questions",
          "description": "Make another form before editing code."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "textarea",
      "id": "additional_notes",
      "title": "Additional notes",
      "description": "Anything else the next agent should know?"
    }
  ]
}
```

Guidelines:
- Every question should have a clear title and description.
- Choice questions are always multi-select checkboxes in the current public DSL; do not add radio/single-select options.
- Choices may include `is_recommended_reason` when the agent recommends an option.
- Use `allowCodeFileChanges`; if the answer returns `allow_code_file_changes=false`, do not edit files—make another form or continue discussion.
- Keep `additional_notes` as the master notes field.

## 2. Attach the form to a bead with inline JSON

Create or choose a bead in the repo where the work belongs, then attach the form with `--stdin`:

```bash
MY_BEADS_DIR=$PWD/vibe-kanban-vscode-web # just an example
cd $MY_BEADS_DIR
bd create "Decide implementation questions" --type task --priority 2

beads-form attach \
  --bead <bead-id> \
  --dir $MY_BEADS_DIR \
  --origin https://jamtools.dev \
  --stdin <<'JSON'
{
  "format": "standard",
  "id": "implementation_questions",
  "title": "Implementation questions",
  "description": "Resolve decisions before code changes.",
  "allowCodeFileChanges": {
    "label": "Allow implementation after this response",
    "description": "Use allow-code only if the next agent may edit code/files.",
    "defaultChecked": false
  },
  "questions": [
    {
      "type": "textarea",
      "id": "additional_notes",
      "title": "Additional notes",
      "description": "Anything else the next agent should know?"
    }
  ]
}
JSON
```

For very small forms, `--json '<raw-json>'` also works. For large forms, `--file form.json` is still supported and can be easier to review/debug.

`beads-form attach` stamps non-empty `VK_WORKSPACE_ID` and `VK_SESSION_ID` values from the environment into bead metadata. Attach also maintains `metadata.beadFormsSummary` (`hasForms`, `hasPendingAnswer`, `pendingResponseCount`, `formIds`, `pendingFormIds`) so Forms can discover pending work efficiently without bulk `bd show` over every bead.

In the VD Docker/dev runtime, `beads-form` should be available on `PATH` globally and should work from any bead repo directory.

The command prints URLs. Provide the remote one to the user, and use explicit markdown link syntax when doing so.

## 3. Share the URL with the human

Send the direct form URL and ask them to submit. After submission:

- Read/process the normalized JSON answer.
- Remove `needs-agent-review` from the bead after processing, if present.
- When messaging another agent about the response, include:
  - the raw DSL JSON,
  - the raw normalized answers JSON,
  - `Please use 'vibe-agent full_summary' to catch up.`

## 4. Inspect attached forms/responses

```bash
beads-form show --bead <bead-id> --dir <repo-dir>
```

`show` outputs JSON by default. Use `--include-html` only when needed.
